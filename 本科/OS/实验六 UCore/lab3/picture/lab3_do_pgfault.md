/*LAB3 EXERCISE 1: YOUR CODE
    * Maybe you want help comment, BELOW comments can help you finish the code
    *
    * Some Useful MACROs and DEFINEs, you can use them in below implementation.
    * MACROs or Functions:
    *   get_pte : get an pte and return the kernel virtual address of this pte for la
    *             if the PT contians this pte didn't exist, alloc a page for PT (notice the 3th parameter '1')
    *   pgdir_alloc_page : call alloc_page & page_insert functions to allocate a page size memory & setup
    *             an addr map pa<--->la with linear address la and the PDT pgdir
    * DEFINES:
    *   VM_WRITE  : If vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE == 1/0, then the vma is writable/non writable
    *   PTE_W           0x002                   // page table/directory entry flags bit : Writeable
    *   PTE_U           0x004                   // page table/directory entry flags bit : User can access
    * VARIABLES:
    *   mm->pgdir : the PDT of these vma
    *

//(1) try to find a pte, if pte's PT(Page Table) isn't existed, then create a PT.
//(2) if the phy addr isn't exist, then alloc a page & map the phy addr with logical addr
