```C
/*LAB3 EXERCISE 2: YOUR CODE
    * Now we think this pte is a  swap entry, we should load data from disk to a page with phy addr,
    * and map the phy addr with logical addr, trigger swap manager to record the access situation of this page.
    *
    *  Some Useful MACROs and DEFINEs, you can use them in below implementation.
    *  MACROs or Functions:
    *    swap_in(mm, addr, &page) : alloc a memory page, then according to the swap entry in PTE for addr,
    *                               find the addr of disk page, read the content of disk page into this memroy page
    *    page_insert ： build the map of phy addr of an Page with the linear addr la
    *    swap_map_swappable ： set the page swappable
