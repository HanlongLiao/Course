```c
/* (3) default_init_memmap:  CALL GRAPH: kern_init --> pmm_init-->page_init-->init_memmap--> pmm_manager->init_memmap
 *              This fun is used to init a free block (with parameter: addr_base, page_number).
 *              First you should init each page (in memlayout.h) in this free block, include:
 *                  p->flags should be set bit PG_property (means this page is valid. In pmm_init fun (in pmm.c),
 *                  the bit PG_reserved is setted in p->flags)
 *                  if this page  is free and is not the first page of free block, p->property should be set to 0.
 *                  if this page  is free and is the first page of free block, p->property should be set to total num of block.
 *                  p->ref should be 0, because now p is free and no reference.
 *                  We can use p->page_link to link this page to free_list, (such as: list_add_before(&free_list, &(p->page_link)); )
 *              Finally, we should sum the number of free mem block: nr_free+=n
